# Features / Highlights
## Business Problem
The "Awesome Chocolates" team was facing several key business challenges due to a lack of a unified data-driven reporting system. They needed to move beyond fragmented data to a holistic, real-time view of their performance.
* Financial Performance: How can we gain real-time visibility into core financial metrics like sales and profit, and track our performance against previous months to quickly respond to market shifts?
* Operational Efficiency: How can we identify inefficiencies within our supply chain, such as low-box shipments, and optimize our logistics to reduce costs and improve overall performance?
* Product Strategy: Which products are the most profitable, and how can we use this information to make data-driven decisions on pricing, marketing, and product development?
* Performance Monitoring: How can we create a system that allows stakeholders to easily track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) against set targets, moving from reactive reporting to proactive decision-making?
## Goal of the Dashboard
The primary goal of this dashboard is to empower stakeholders to move from reactive reporting to proactive decision-making. It serves as a centralized hub for actionable business intelligence.
Specifically, this tool is designed to:
* Enable Strategic Decision-Making: Provide executives and managers with a consolidated, top-level view of sales, profit, and costs to guide strategic planning and resource allocation.
* Enhance Operational Efficiency: Uncover key trends and insights within shipment and product data to identify inefficiencies and optimize the supply chain.
* Drive Profitability: Allow for granular analysis of product performance, helping to identify high-margin items to focus on and low-margin products to reconsider.
* Monitor Performance in Real-Time: Give the team a dynamic tool to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as month-over-month changes, against business targets.
# Walkthrough of Key Visuals
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Total Sales
This KPI represents the overall revenue generated.
Formula: Total Sales = SUM('Sales'[Total Sales])
Value: $34M
* Total Profit
This is a core financial metric that calculates the total profit after costs.
Formula: Profit = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])
Value: $21M
* Total Boxes
This metric tracks the total number of boxes sold, which is an important operational KPI for managing inventory and logistics.
Formula: Total Boxes = SUM('Shipments'[Boxes])
Value: 2M
* Total Shipments
This metric counts the total number of shipments, essential for supply chain analysis.
Formula: Total Shipments = DISTINCTCOUNT('Shipments'[Shipments])
Value: 6K
* Profit %
This metric shows the profit margin as a percentage, a key measure of a product's or the company's profitability.
Formula: Profit % = DIVIDE([Profit], [Total Sales])
Value: 60.29% (from the gauge chart visual)
* Month-over-Month (MoM) Sales Growth
This metric measures the percentage change in sales from the previous month, providing insight into business momentum.
Formula: Latest MoM Sales Change % = VAR prev_month_sales = CALCULATE( [Total Sales], DATEADD( 'calendar'[Date], -1, MONTH ) ) RETURN DIVIDE( [Total Sales] - prev_month_sales, prev_month_sales )
Value: -10.76%
## Parameter for Dynamic Visuals
This project includes a custom Parameter table, which is a powerful feature for enhancing user interactivity. It enables stakeholders to dynamically change the metric displayed in the Sales Analysis visual from a slicer or filter. This allows for a more flexible and user-driven analysis without the need for multiple static charts.
The parameter is designed to work with key measures, allowing users to switch between viewing Sales, Boxes, Shipments, Cost, or Profit on the same chart. This provides a single-source solution for multiple analytical needs.
* DAX Formula for the Parameter
The parameter table is created using a DAX formula. Each line of the formula defines a new field that can be selected by the user. The syntax includes the display name of the metric, a reference to the actual measure, and an optional sort order.
* Code snippet
Parameter = {
    ("Sales", NAMEOF('Measures (2)'[Total Sales]), 0),
    ("Boxes", NAMEOF('Measures (2)'[Total Boxes]), 1),
    ("Shipments", NAMEOF('Measures (2)'[Total Shipments]), 2),
    ("Cost", NAMEOF('Measures (2)'[Total Cost]), 3),
    ("Profit", NAMEOF('Measures (2)'[Total Profit]), 4)
}
This formula creates a disconnected table that can be used in visuals, giving the end-user full control over the data they want to see, which is an excellent demonstration of advanced Power BI skills.
## Sales Analysis Graph
A dynamic line chart that visualizes Sales, Boxes, Shipments, Cost, or Profit over a 13-month period. It leverages a custom parameter field on the Y-axis, allowing users to select the metric they want to analyze, thus providing a flexible and interactive tool for time-series analysis.
## Shipment Analysis
The shipment analysis section is designed to provide insight into operational efficiency. It includes a bar chart with a zoom slider that visualizes the distribution of shipments by box bins. This allows for detailed analysis of shipment volumes. Additionally, a donut chart highlights the LBS% (Low Box Shipments), a key operational KPI that measures the percentage of all shipments that fall into a low-box category.
# ### Performance Analysis Tables
The dashboard utilizes two interconnected tables‚Äî**Product Performance** and **Sales Person Performance**‚Äîthat leverage bookmarks for seamless navigation. This professional design choice allows stakeholders to instantly pivot between different levels of analysis, from products to people. Both tables include a **Profit Target Indicator** (‚úÖ or ‚ùå) that visually tracks performance against a set goal, enabling a quick and intuitive assessment of top performers and areas needing improvement.
* **Product Performance Table:** This table provides a **granular breakdown** of each product's sales, profit, and **Profit %**. The visual indicator makes it easy to spot which products are meeting or exceeding profitability targets.
* **Sales Person Performance Table:** This table shifts the analytical focus to the sales team's contributions. It breaks down key metrics by individual, allowing managers to use the **Profit Target Indicator** to assess individual performance and make data-driven decisions on coaching or incentives.
